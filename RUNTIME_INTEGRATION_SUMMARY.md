# Runtime API Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the runtime-api with Vibe to manage remote runtimes for Riffs. This implementation provides automatic runtime lifecycle management for each Riff.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Runtime Service (`backend/services/runtime_service.py`)
Created a comprehensive `RuntimeService` class that handles all runtime-api interactions:

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Runtime Creation**: Starts new runtime when Riff is created
- **Status Management**: Checks runtime status and handles pause/resume operations
- **Agent Reset Handling**: Automatically manages runtime state during agent resets
- **Health Monitoring**: Provides runtime-api health check functionality

**Methods:**
- `start_runtime(user_uuid, app_slug, riff_slug)` - Creates new remote runtime
- `get_runtime_status(user_uuid, app_slug, riff_slug)` - Gets current runtime status
- `pause_runtime(session_id)` - Pauses a running runtime
- `resume_runtime(session_id)` - Resumes a paused runtime
- `handle_agent_reset(user_uuid, app_slug, riff_slug)` - Manages runtime during agent reset
- `get_api_health()` - Checks runtime-api service health

### 2. Riff Integration (`backend/routes/riffs.py`)
Modified existing Riff management to include runtime lifecycle:

**Riff Creation Enhancement:**
- Automatically starts remote runtime when new Riff is created
- Stores runtime information in Riff data:
  - `runtime_id`: Unique runtime identifier
  - `runtime_url`: Runtime access URL
  - `session_api_key`: Session authentication key

**Agent Reset Enhancement:**
- Checks runtime status before local agent reset
- Automatically unpauses runtime if it's paused
- Starts new runtime if previous one is not available

### 3. New API Endpoints
Added two new endpoints for runtime status monitoring:

**General Runtime API Status:**
```
GET /api/runtime/status
```
Returns the health status of the runtime-api service.

**Riff-Specific Runtime Status:**
```
GET /api/apps/<slug>/riffs/<riff_slug>/runtime/status
```
Returns the runtime status for a specific Riff.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The service uses the following environment variables:

- `RUNTIME_API_URL`: Runtime API base URL (default: `https://runtime-api-staging.all-hands.dev`)
- `RUNTIME_API_STAGING_SECRET`: Admin API key for runtime-api authentication

### Runtime Configuration
- **Default Image**: `ghcr.io/all-hands-ai/agent-server:8daf576-python`
- **Session ID Format**: `{user_uuid}:{app_slug}:{riff_slug}`
- **Session API Key**: Set to user's UUID in runtime environment

## Workflow

### New Riff Creation
1. User creates new Riff via API
2. System automatically calls runtime-api `/start` endpoint
3. Runtime information stored in Riff data
4. Riff is ready with both local and remote runtime

### Agent Reset
1. User triggers agent reset
2. System checks current runtime status
3. If runtime is paused, it's automatically resumed
4. If runtime doesn't exist, new one is created
5. Local agent is reset after runtime is ready

### Status Monitoring
1. General health check available at `/api/runtime/status`
2. Riff-specific status at `/api/apps/<slug>/riffs/<riff_slug>/runtime/status`
3. Both endpoints provide detailed status information

## Dependencies
- `requests` library for HTTP calls to runtime-api
- Existing Flask application structure
- Runtime-API service availability

## Security
- Uses X-API-Key header for runtime-api authentication
- Session API keys are user-specific (UUID-based)
- All runtime operations are user-scoped

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when runtime-api is unavailable
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Proper HTTP status codes for all scenarios
- Fallback behavior for missing environment variables

## Testing
The implementation has been tested for:
- ✅ Service import and initialization
- ✅ Environment variable handling
- ✅ Method signatures and basic functionality
- ✅ Integration with existing Riff management

## Next Steps
To deploy this integration:

1. Set environment variables in production:
   ```bash
   export RUNTIME_API_URL="https://runtime-api-staging.all-hands.dev"
   export RUNTIME_API_STAGING_SECRET="your-admin-api-key"
   ```

2. Ensure runtime-api service is accessible from Vibe backend

3. Monitor logs for runtime operations during Riff creation and agent resets

4. Test with actual Riff workflows to verify end-to-end functionality
